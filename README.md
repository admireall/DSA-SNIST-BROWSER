# DSA-SNIST-BROWSER

SNIST Browser is a Java-based project developed during a hackathon, aiming to simulate a web browser with basic tab management and navigation functionalities. The project utilizes fundamental data structures and algorithms to create a functional browser-like experience within the command-line interface.

Key Features:
Tab Management: Implements tab management using a linked list structure to dynamically add, remove, and navigate between tabs.

Navigation: Supports basic navigation functionalities such as forward and backward navigation within tabs, allowing users to revisit previously opened websites.

History Tracking: Maintains a history of visited websites and provides users the ability to view the most recently closed tab.

Analytics: Includes basic analytics features to determine the most and least visited websites based on user interaction.

How to Use:
Adding Tabs: Users can add new tabs with specific website names.

Opening Websites: Allows users to open websites in specified tabs, maintaining a history of visited websites.

Navigation: Provides functionalities to navigate forward and backward within tabs to revisit previous websites.

Display Tabs: Displays the current list of open tabs and their contents.

Closing Browser: Supports closing the browser session, clearing all tab data and ending the program.

Technologies Used:
Language: Java
Data Structures: Linked list for tab management, hash maps for tracking website counts and tab content.
Development Environment: Developed and tested using Java SE Development Kit (JDK) and IntelliJ IDEA IDE.
Future Enhancements:
UI Integration: Enhance user experience with a graphical user interface (GUI) for easier navigation and management.

Advanced Analytics: Implement more sophisticated analytics features to provide deeper insights into user browsing patterns.
